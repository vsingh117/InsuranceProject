# InsuranceProject

The project is created to predict insurance portfolio loss ratio.
Following are the script atached to develop a solution :-
Datawrangle.ipynb :- The script is used to analyze the data and perform data wrangling on the basis of assumptions made during the study.
Split_Data.ipynb :- The script is used to split huge data into multiple portfolios such that the loss ratio among the portfolio is evenly distributed.
Pwise-LGB.ipynb :- The script is used to design a XGB bosst predictive model to predict the loss ratio for portfolios.
Pwise-L2.ipynb  :- The script is used to design a L2 regression predictive model to predict the loss ratio for portfolios.
