# InsuranceProject

The project is created to predict insurance portfolio loss ratio.</br>
Following are the script atached to develop a solution :- </br>
Datawrangle.ipynb :- The script is used to analyze the data and perform data wrangling on the basis of assumptions made during the study. </br>
Split_Data.ipynb :- The script is used to split huge data into multiple portfolios such that the loss ratio among the portfolio is evenly distributed. </br>
Pwise-LGB.ipynb :- The script is used to design a XGB bosst predictive model to predict the loss ratio for portfolios. </br>
Pwise-L2.ipynb  :- The script is used to design a L2 regression predictive model to predict the loss ratio for portfolios. </br>
